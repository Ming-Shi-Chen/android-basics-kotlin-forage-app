A fork from  Google-developer-training  :Forage - Starter Code
==================================
The original starter code use databinding„ÄÅand Dao to store and display the UI.

I add a little change as my practice project

I Add a date data  column to store the date that user whant to have a days count down.
And the date was choose by a DatePickerDialog
The date data is store by Room in SQLite Local database.

Furture changes
=========================================
I want to add the Repository Pattern into this practice.
And change the dataBase into remote database , like Firebase etc....
Maybe add a column  to store Bitmap data.
